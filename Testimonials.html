    <q>I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to try this place for a while— the fact that the windows start to glow purple every night at 3am always made me nervous— but wow am I pleasantly surprised!! The coffee was delicious, the ambience is lovely, and the staff are so attentive! From the moment I sat down to the moment I left, the employees were all watching me, waiting to see if I needed something— I don’t think they even blinked! I’ve never felt more taken care of. And the coffee!  If you need something to keep you awake and work your brain, this is the place. I’ve been awake for days, and I’ve never felt more creative, it’s like there’s a whole other voice in my head! All in all, it was a wonderful experience, and I will be recommending the Eldritch Coffeeshop  to everyone I know.</q>

    <q>I was strolling down clock street with a friend and just as we commented on wanting some coffee, we realised we were in front of the Eldritch Coffeeshop! There was a lure to the place that we couldn't describe but we knew in our blood that we had to go in. Best decision ever! The owners are a lovely couple, and they were so welcoming. We immediately changed our shoes for clogs and headed for our assigned seats. And the drinks were incredible as well! I don't quite recall what I ordered but it was definitely worth the deal! Truly an amazing place, it's now my go to spot every Monday and Thursday!</q>

    <q> I first found The Eldritch Coffeeshop by accident, it was a rainy day and I was trying to escape the weather when I saw the warm purple glow from the windows and the most divine scent of coffee hit my nose.I walked inside, the interior was a mix of modern and what can be described as "Fantasy Chic" The owners greeted me by name and with a warm smile, how nice of them to pay attention to my name tag! 
        I was struggling to decide on the drinks, seeing how pricey "The Blood Of The Entity" was, but after a brief discussion and the staffs interest in my life, they convinced me to purchase one.
    It was the best decision of my life, I was filled with energy and focus. I didn't sleep for almost a week and the moment I began feeling tired I went back and bought another! I haven't slept in over a year at this point. The entity speaks to me in my dreams, tells me of the better future we will build together, as a family. You should definitely stop on by some time!  </q>

    <q>On my walk home I was interrupted by unannounced construction that made me take a different path straight past this new coffee shop! I had been stricken with an abrupt wave of exhaustion about 10 minutes before, so I decided to check it out. Surprisingly, the shop was empty but the couple running it were so warm and inviting!  The woman told me all about their coffee that grew in this remote region and was also paired with a brilliant purple berry also native only there.  Her husband then sat down with me and told me all about the history of the location and let me wear their ceremonial robes while enjoying my coffee!  They were quite possibly the smoothest material I had ever felt, and the clogs seemed like they almost molded to my feet with how perfect the fits were!! I've never felt so refreshed by coffee and promised to be back to see them before I could even think about it!

        Great vibes, atmosphere, and coffee!.  </q>

 <q> March 11th, 2023: Never would I think that a coffeeshop/clog fitter/cobbler was what the neighborhood needed, but I can absolutely say without a doubt that we needed this. Just one sip of the "Blood Of The Entity" drink will have you absolutely rabid for more. 10/10 stars  </q>
